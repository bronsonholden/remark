# Remark

Digital chatter at human scale and human pace.

# About

Remark was born from a curiosity about Twitter- and Instagram-like apps,
specifically how they surface content. I also wanted my own site to post
thoughts, pictures, and eventually, blog posts.

I implemented text-based image searching, similar image surfacing, a
simple comment/like system, conversion tracking (to positively reinforce
posts—"remarks"—in search results).
